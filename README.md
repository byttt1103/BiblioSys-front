# BiblioSys-front

A front-end design for the BiblioSys project.
---

Disclaimer: This is just a design draft for the project. Don't expect to work properly.

BiblioSys is a web-based bibliographic material management system, with user management and social features. 

It allows libraries to manage their material inventory (such as books and physical audiovisual materials) more efficiently, while keeping it updated. Also, it has a loaning system, where users can search for books or any other material, reserve them if available, loan them and check the status of all the loans they have (its due date, when was it lent, which material was lent,). 

This system not only aims to be a practical library management system, but also a web platform that can promote the library itself, expanding the library's audience and promoting its events and services. This is because many awesome things that offers a library doesn't get as much promotions as deserved, and that's why this system also offers a news/blog section.

This is my very first big project, and I hope it gets developed in good conditions.
