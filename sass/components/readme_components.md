# Components or shared components
## What are these for?

This folder helps us to place and organize all the modular pieces that can we use in all of the document style.

Apart from global variables, these components are complete blocks with their own style. In other words, components are SCSS complete code blocks, that will be compiled as is.

They often have independent styles (but hey can use some global varialbes because, why not), and they can be reused throughout all the project.

## Any example?
Yes, the `_navbar.scss` file is a component.
